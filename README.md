## Neighbourhood Map


This project is the part of the Udacity Fullstack nanodegree program
This is for showing my favorite places in Seattle and details about the places.

It provides the search feature to search from one of the locations.
Also Foursquare API is used to provide information about each of the places.
A live version of this is available in the below link :
