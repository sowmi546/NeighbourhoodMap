## Neighbourhood Map


This project is the part of the Udacity Fullstack nanodegree program
This is for showing my favorite places in Seattle and details about the places.

## Features 
Filtering of the places in Seattle is provided using Knockout JS
Responsiveness is addressed and renders well on mobile and various devices of different sizes.
Also Foursquare API is used to provide information about each of the places and error handling is done in case there are issues with retriving information.

A live version of this is available in the below link :
